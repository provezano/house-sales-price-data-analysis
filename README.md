# House Sales Price - Data Analysis
## Objective

Here is, I'm using the [House Sales in King County, USA Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)
to do some data analysis and practice some data visualization and deployment skills.

After all, **I ended up developing and publishing a dashboard on Heroku** to be used in the daily lives of business people, but the main question I want to answer is: **"Which houses should I buy for resale?"**
